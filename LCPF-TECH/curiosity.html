            <h1>The history of RFID</h1>
            <p>
                Sir Robert Alexander  Watson-Watt, a Scottish physicist, discovered in 1935 the function of the radars that were used during World War II by the Germans, Americans, British and Japonese to warn them in advance of planes while they were still far away. At that time, the problem was to identify among these planes which was the enemy and which was the ally. Based on this, the Germans realized that if their pilots rotated their aircraft when ther were returning to base, they would modify the radio signal that would be reflected back to the radar. This discovery made it possible to alert for the radar that it was a German aircraft.

                Sir Robert Alexander Watson-Watt, together with his team, developed a secret project for the British that gave rise to the first aircraft identifier called IFF(Identify Friend or Foe). A transmitterwas then inserted into each British aircraft to detect the signals through ground radar stations, receiving a response signal that identified the friendly aircraft. The creation of RFID technology has its origins in this discovery, as an RFID works on the same principle, in which a signal is sent to a transponder that reflects the waves and transmits them with its own signal. In the 1950s and 1960s, American, European and Japanese scientists proved that radio frequency could be used to remotely identify products and objects. It was through these researches that electronic surveillance tags emerged that indicated, for example, when merchandise was leaving a store without removing the product tag, activating an audible alarm to prevent theft.

                In the 1980s, the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) began the study of an architecture that would use the resources of radiofrequency-based technologies to serve as a reference model for the development of new tracking and product location applications.
                This study gave rise to the EPC (Electronic Product Code). The EPC defined a standard architecture for identifying products that used resources provided by radio frequency signals. Unlike the beam of light used in the barcode system, RFID uses radio frequency to capture information. Thus, the study showed that its assertiveness was proportionally greater.
                EPC proved that it was possible to streamline processes and increase product visibility by making information available, creating the concept of total product tracking – not just for a process or a company, but for each individual product in the entire chain of supplies. Then came EPCglobal, a non-profit organization to manage and foster the development of RFID technology.
                EPCglobal has gone on to spearhead numerous initiatives to standardize RFID for applications in supply chain management, such as the interfaces between the various components in order to create standards for the communications protocol between the tag and the reader, between the reader and computers and between computers on the internet.

                <h2>The advantages of RFID</h2>
                    <p>
                        The main advantages of using RFID tags in logistical scenarios and in stock management are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Capacity to store, read and send data – RFID tags allow the recording of information on them
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Detection without the need for proximity to the reader for data recognition – RFID tags can be read from a distance
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Durability of labels with the possibility of reuse
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reduction of common errors in stocks
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Instant inventory count, facilitating enterprise inventory systems
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Accuracy in storage information and shipping speed both storage and picking and packing processes are streamlined
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Location of items still in search processes – separation
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Improved replenishment with elimination of missing items and those with expired validity
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Prevention of theft and forgery of goods
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Optimization of the management process, allowing companies to operate with much more agility and ensuring lower operational capacity, as processes are more assertive
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            </aside>
