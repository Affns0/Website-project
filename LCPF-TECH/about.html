                The story of this company consists in making life easier and delivering with
                excellence, on time service in each product we send to our clients.
                This company was created to reach all the problems on controlling where your
                unique products are, without you having to be preoccupied. It's our system that
                makes all magic to you, scanning each one of your packages with a different system
                that calls RFID TAG (which inside our boxes, you can find one that stores a number
                in. It is going to be used as a unique identification and plus, RFID is a contactless
                technology where everything is just one digital moment to your hands continuously
                and precisely.
                Our service remains basically on the client being in control of every step that his
                product gives.
                It's a GPS controller, using the RFID technology tag, in each carbon box that is
                returnable to us, in this way, helping the ecosystem, so we don't have to expend
                loads on industrial material, and we have been prepare in case of one of our boxes
                gat damaged, we replace them, and depending on who's make the damage, we
                charge them with a contribution to help us on keeping our service flowing
                We have become one of the top names in our field serving the customers with
                precision, stability, and rapidly growing, reaching the market as we have planned:
                showing our potential to deal and care for the products and delivering our service
                carefully, responsible, and protecting all the clientsâ€™ properties as they are ours. In
                the last year, the company has grown from 40 to 130 clients, expanding, and
                improving in our technology to serve every day even better. The company was
                founded upon the belief that we could really make the difference in front of other
                projects that already exists, so for us fundamental that we reach each part of our
                company with stability, kindness, and passion on serving, followed to ethically and
                validly design, conduct, manage, analyse, and report to ours internal controlling
                area.
                Since we got together and decided to create LCPF Technology, we as friends had
                established a compromise to the future, which is our most concern and our priority,
                constantly developing news upgrades where our services can reach even areas that
                the world hasn't been prepared to see yet. Since we are non-hierarchical structure,
                we have several other facets where we embrace change, we maintain ourselves
                innovating, and we share a common purpose: making lives easier.
                LPFC's major goal is to provide traceability services to our clients, enabling them to
                keep location or destination records of every asset they own, making the inventory
                processes quicker at lower costs, enabling them to use the latest wireless
                technology while tracing the location or destination of assets on the go.
                How far we have been using a new technology and old mode of delivering our
                services, carbon boxes, we also maintain all of our sources in our local community,
                employing our nearest families into our production sector and sharing with them our
                passion to our product.
