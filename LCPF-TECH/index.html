            <h2>RFID tag</h2>
            <p>
                RFID: Radio Frequency Identification. Items receive an RFID tag with important information about the item. In the company/ industry/ retail, antennas, readers, portals and RFID shelves that communicate with the server are distributed. And the server integrates the tag information with its ERP, so it can have control of all the information contained in the tag.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the product is shipped, RFID tags are printed and glued to the boxes that will be stored.
                When these boxes leave the factory, they go through a portal identifying and reading these tags, and when they arrive at the warehouse, they go through a new portal identifying and releasing the items to the system.
                At the warehouse, RFID readers are used to track inventories and identify products upon departure.
                When the batch leaves the warehouse, it goes through the same portal that entered it and when it arrives at the Distribution Center's stock as well.
                The monitoring of the entire cycle can be monitored by your ERP until delivery to the end customer.
                The customer, in turn, has the possibility to know the entire route of the purchased product. Quality seal and guaranteed commitment.
                Imagine how much time was saved in this process by not having to intercept deliveries and check box by box. Even compared to the use of barcode, the gain in counting speed is already much greater. In one hour it is possible to count 300 items with a barcode, while with RFID it is possible to count 10,000 items in the same time.
